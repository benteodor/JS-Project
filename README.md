 ## Description 
This JS course was purchased through Udemy. I've had a lot of practice with new JS words and concepts. I learned how to use document.getElementById, console.log, document.querySelector, functions, if, else if, const,.addEventListener, let, setInterval, and return, as well as how and when to use them. This course was really comprehensive, and I learned a lot of JS theory in order to create a responsive website with some functionality.
